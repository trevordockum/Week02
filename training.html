            <p>Training packs and freeplay training are both extremely important when you first get on the game and
                start
                " warming up". Both are very useful to at least get your fingers active on the joysticks and give you a
            good judgement as to whether or not you're goig to be playing mechanical for the day or not. There are
            thounsands of custom training packs to explore to directly hone in your skills.</p>
