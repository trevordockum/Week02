        <p>Playing Rocket League can be an unforgiving experience once you get heavily invested. Rank sessions become
            daunting and at the end of the day are one of the hardest grinds out there. In order to be prepared to que
            up a session there are a few things you need to know to optimize your time and energy while on the field.

        <!--I used an h2 header below to title a new section and begin to define a list.
                I selected an organized list to outline each step chronologically. I also sectioned
                accordingly for visual aspects.-->
        <section>
            <h2><u>Necessary things players do to prepare:</u></h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Sleep in. You need your beauty sleep in order to be in <i>peak</i> playing mode by early afternoon!
                </li>
                <li>Take a SHOWER. It is very important to shower up before you sweat. We aim to smell bad after the
                    session
                    not before.</li>
                <li>Touch some <b>GRASS!!!</b> This one is detrimental to your health and mental clarity. Get outside,
                    put
                    your feet in some dirt, and soak up some earth vibrations.</li>
                <li>CAFFEINE. 150mg at least. GFUEL is usually the best option.</li>
            </ol>

        <!--I utilized a few images to provide visual represenation of each step in the organized list 
            in order from left to right. These images somehow magically appeared smallest to largest almost 
            signifying a hierarchy of importance as well! Great outcome, not at all planned :)-->

        <p>As you can see having some sort of routine is key in ensuring optimal mental clarity and performance
            before you even boot up the game. Lots of players utilize all different kinds of techniques however
            they are all very similar across the board. <i>GFUEL</i> is a very common gaming enhancement energy drink
            that hundres of thousands of people drink daily to aid their ability to process information quicker.
            It's a litte deeper than just intaking caffeine. Every small win adds up to big wins on the field!
